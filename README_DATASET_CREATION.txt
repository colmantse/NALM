1. Obtain the preprocessed data from Schmaltz's version of ptb data following instructions from https://github.com/allenschmaltz/word_ordering

2. This will give us both the original ptb2016 data from treebank3 and the fullyshuffled data from Schmaltz preprocessing.

3. Run ngram_encoder.py and modify the paths and variable as needed to replicate our preprocessing of the original ptb2016 data via ngram permutation.
